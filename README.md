# Super-Mart
I've created a modern, responsive e-commerce website with the following features:

Navbar: With search, cart, wishlist, and account options
Hero Section: Dynamic banner with promotional content
Categories: Easy navigation with icon-based category selection
Product Grid: Responsive product display with:
Product images
Pricing
Discount badges
Add to cart/wishlist buttons
Footer: Comprehensive footer with:
Quick links
Newsletter signup
Social media links
Customer service links
The design uses:

Modern, clean UI with subtle animations
Responsive layout that works on all devices
Professional color scheme with blue as primary color
High-quality product images from Unsplash
Lucide icons for consistent visual language
The development server is now running and you can see the website in action. Would you like me to add any specific features or make any adjustments?
